# NOTICE

This is for Foundation 2.X.  The current zurb-foundation gem is now hosted at: https://github.com/zurb/foundation

# WELCOME TO FOUNDATION

Foundation is a rock-solid, responsive framework for rapidly prototyping and iterating into production code. It includes a 12-column, future-friendly grid and tons of great tools and elements that'll get you up and running in no time.

Homepage:      http://foundation.zurb.com
Documentation: http://foundation.zurb.com/docs

Foundation is MIT-licensed and absolutely free to use. Foundation wouldn't be possible without the support of the entire ZURB team, our friends and colleagues who gave feedback, and some luminaries who did some heavy lifting that we took advantage of (thanks guys).

# Installation


Inside your Gemfile add the following line:

```ruby
group :assets do
  gem 'zurb-foundation', '~> 2.2'
end
```

Then run `bundle install` to install the gem.

## What now?

If you want to include Foundation on all of your application pages (and why wouldn't you!) then run the following to append `foundation` to your application sprockets files:

```bash
rails g foundation:install
```

You can also manually include `foundation` on specific pages using:

```ruby
stylesheet_link_tag "foundation"
javascript_include_tag "foundation"
```

Or add `require "foundation"` to your sprockets files like so:

**in application.css**

```css
/*= require "foundation" */
```

**in application.js**

```javascript
//= require "foundation"
```

### Advanced

If you wish to be more selective about which Foundation files you'd like to use in your project that's possible too!  So instead of using `require "foundation"` you can selectively add stylesheets and javascripts to your project like so:

**in application.css**

```css
/*
*= require "foundation/globals"
*= require "foundation/typography"
*/
```

**in application.js**

```javascript
//= require "foundation/forms.jquery"
//= require "foundation/jquery.customforms"
//= require "foundation/app"
```
This gem contains the same files as the corresponding Foundation release, which currently is:

**Stylesheets**

  * globals
  * typography
  * grid
  * ui
  * forms
  * orbit
  * reveal
  * mobile

**JavaScripts**

  * jquery.reveal
  * jquery.orbit-1.3.0
  * forms.jquery
  * jquery.customforms
  * jquery.placeholder.min
  * app

### Set the viewport

Finally you'll also want to add the following line to the `<head>` section in your layout file (i.e. `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`) so the design will scale for mobile devices:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

You can also use the included generator to accomplish the same thing:

```bash
rails g foundation:layout
```
Use the `--help` argument to see more options, like how generate the layout with HAML or Slim.

# Using foundation in production

Before pushing your application to production, you'll need to determine how you want your assets served.  You can either compile them on-the-fly or precompile them (recommended).  Before continuing you'll want to check your Rails application Gemfile and ensure that `gem "zurb-foundation"` is included in the `assets` group.

## To compile on-the-fly

In your Rails application edit `config/application.rb` and change:

```ruby
Bundler.require(*Rails.groups(:assets => %w(development test)))
```

to:

```ruby
Bundler.require(:default, :assets, Rails.env)
```

Then in `config/environments/production.rb` make sure the following setting exists:

```ruby
config.assets.compile = true
```

Now all your assets will be compiled the first time someone visits your site, which can cause some delay.  Kind of like the first time Passenger spins up your application after it has been idle for some time.

## To precompile assets using Capistrano

In your Rails application edit `Capfile` and add the following line after `load 'deploy'`:

```ruby
load 'deploy/assets'
```

Now when you run `cap deploy` the `deploy:assets:precompile` task will be run which takes care of running `bundle exec rake assets:precompile` for you.

By default assets that are precompiled will be located in the `public/assets/` folder of your application.

## Why use this gem?


* Easy to setup: Start using Foundation in mere seconds, like a boss
* Paths: All images will work regardless of if you deploy to a sub-uri or not
* Clean: Don't clutter up your assets directory

# Dependencies

* rails (~> 3.1)
* jquery-rails (~> 1.0)
